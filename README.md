# Prediction-of-Loan-Payment-ability (Home Credit Default Risk)
A home is not only a major investment for the buyers but also a challenging decision for the mortgage loan lenders as it takes decades to pay off. Among such lenders, Home credit aka, Home Credit B.V., an international non-bank financial institution founded in 1997 in the Czech Republic and headquartered in Netherlands, currently operates in 10 countries including USA and focuses on lending home loan primarily to people with little or no credit history which will either not obtain loans or became victims of untrustworthly lenders.  Hence, Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience by the use of a variety of alternative data, including telco and transactional information, to predict their clients' repayment abilities in addition to their credit history. Hence, in this project we aim to build a robust model to predict the client’s repayment abilities by employing the various features of the client’s such as: employment, financial status, family status, education and many more rather than solely depending on credit histories.
